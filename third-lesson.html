					<!-- colours, RGB, rgb function and HEX -->
					<h3>Colours</h3>
					<p>
						You can set colour in HTML by three methods: name, RGB [red, green, blue] and HEX.
					</p>
					<h5>Colour names</h5>
					<p>
						Most part of colour names which you know will be right for HTML: <span class="colours">black, <span class="white">white</span>, <span class="red">red</span>, <span class="orange">orange</span>, <span class="yellow">yellow</span>, <span class="green">green</span>, <span class="blue">blue</span>, <span class="indigo">indigo</span>, <span class="violet">violet</span></span>. And there also more extravagant colours like <span class="colours"><span class="aqua">aqua</span>, <span class="AliceBlue">AliceBlue</span>, <span class="Bisque">Bisque</span>, <span class="Coral">Coral</span>, <span class="Teal">Teal</span>, <span class="Pink">Pink</span>, <span class="DeepPink">DeepPink</span>, <span class="HotPink">HotPink</span></span>. I recommend you look at names with the prefix "Light", they look good. You can see them at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>.
					</p>
					<h5>RGB</h5>
					<p>
						RGB colour it's mixing of red, green and blue intensity. As you know no intensity is no light, though it's black colour. High-intensity of all channels is white. If you will mix red and blue you will get yellow. The intensity of each if these colours can be in the range from 0 to 255. And it's greater than sixteen millions colours - quite enough to make a good design. To pick a colour from RBG you can use <code>rgb</code> function. For example, you want to pick red with half intensity and you will need to write in property [red is first]: <code>rgb(127, 0, 0);</code>.
					</p>
<h5>HEX</h5>
<p>
	HEX and RGB are things of the same sort. HEX picks  a colour from RGB palette, but you need to set it in hex numbers. There are three pairs of numbers. The first pair is red, second is green and the last one is blue - RRGGBB: 000000 - no intensity - black, FFFFFF - high-intensity - white, FF0000 - red, 00FF00 - green,  0000FF - blue, FF00FF - yellow. If all three pairs have same numbers you can make them short, 000 - black, FFF - white, 888 - grey. When you're setting colour property you need to put hashtag/number before HEX: <code>p {color: #000;}</code> - black colour of paragraphes, but will be better set it by this line of code: <code>p {color: black;}</code>. Use colour names, instead of numbers if you know name.
</p>
<p>
	If you will use HEX or RGB I recommend you to find a colour picker, which will be convert chosen a colour to RGB or HEX.
</p>
<h3></h3>

<h3>Selector</h3>
<p>
	To set any property of element of the page you need to say which one element. This part goes before curly braces and named as <b>selector</b>. In example from colours section you can see that in selector is <code>p</code>. You can set any displable tag in body. You can specify selectors by different ways. <code>div p { color: gray; }</code> - this line of code defined that all paragraphs of all divisions should be grey. If division has a table, where in column of this table paragraph and this paragraph will be grey. What if you need to set paragraphs which are only in division [not in tables, which are in division]? In this case you need this line of code with greater than symbol: <code>div > p {color: black;}</code>.
